We have 4 pages to do in total, the main page (index.html) which explains how to play and shows attribution
-- it links to the intro.html which is the start of the story (description of one normal day at dawson up to the decision),
the decision is to open or ignore the file, each being a link to two different pages : open.html and ignore.html.

Each page (intro, open and close .html) have their own unique .json file to store scene and text information.
- All files share one main script for the most important functionality (click to show text, load the next scene, etc.), plus they can have their own script for additional specific stuff.
- All files would share the same allStyles.css file for styles, and specific styling can be changed through a style tag.

On Git: There is the main branch which will contain clean and reviewed code and the dev branch where most of the work and testing will happened.
When implementing a new feature and testing it, create another branch from the dev branch and work it on there
-- then as for a pull from the testing branch to the dev branch where it can be reviewed / merge conflicts fixed.
Once its pulled, delete the feature branch.
